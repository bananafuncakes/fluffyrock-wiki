# Information

## Synopsis

fluffyrock-1088-megares-offset-noise is an older model that uses offset-noise. Which was a technique that was used to sort of "hack" Stable Diffusion into outputting better contrast. It is recommended to use the newer fluffyrock-1088-megares-terminal-snr or fluffyrock-1088-megares-vpred

At the moment, the model is being tested with an SDXL VAE. Which is still under experimentation.

## Discoveries

Experimentation with the model has showed improvements in capabilities overall in contrast and some colour.
